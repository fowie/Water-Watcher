# Orchestration Log — Bodhi (Lead)

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-24T22:35:00Z
**Mode:** sync
**Session:** initial-build

## Summary
Architecture and stack decisions, project scaffolding. Created full project structure, chose Next.js 15 + Python + PostgreSQL stack.

## Work Performed
- Selected tech stack: Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript), Tailwind CSS v4, PostgreSQL 16, Prisma, Python 3.11+, SQLAlchemy 2.0, APScheduler, Web Push API
- Designed two-service layout: `web/` (Next.js) + `pipeline/` (Python), sharing PostgreSQL as the integration contract
- Defined data flow architecture: Scrapers → Processors → PostgreSQL ↔ API Routes → Frontend
- Created full project scaffolding: README.md, docker-compose.yml, .env.example, Prisma schema, pipeline structure
- Made 5 architecture decisions (ADR-001 through ADR-005): stack selection, project structure, data flow, notification strategy, API design
- Rejected alternatives: full-TypeScript monorepo, SQLite, Redis+Celery, Drizzle ORM, tRPC

## Files Touched
- `README.md`
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `.env.example`
- `web/` (scaffolding)
- `pipeline/` (scaffolding)
- `web/prisma/schema.prisma`

## Decisions Filed
- ADR-001: Tech Stack Selection
- ADR-002: Two-Service Layout
- ADR-003: Data Flow Architecture
- ADR-004: Notification Strategy
- ADR-005: API Design
