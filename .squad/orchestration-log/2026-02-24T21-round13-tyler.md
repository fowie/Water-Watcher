# Orchestration Log — Tyler (Frontend Dev)

**Timestamp:** 2026-02-24T21:00:00Z
**Mode:** background
**Session:** round13

## Summary
Created admin user management page, comprehensive accessibility audit (aria-current, aria-live, aria-expanded, skip-to-content, keyboard shortcuts overlay, focus trap in search palette).

## Work Performed
- Built admin user management page at `/admin/users` with client-side admin role check (reads `session.user.role`)
- Role dropdown uses native `<select>` styled as pill badge (better accessibility than Radix Select for simple two-option choice)
- Users cannot change their own role to prevent accidental self-demotion
- Created `KeyboardShortcuts` component — full-screen overlay triggered by `?` key (except in inputs/textareas/selects), mounted at Navigation level alongside SearchPalette
- Comprehensive accessibility audit applied across all components:
  - All icon-only buttons have `aria-label`
  - All decorative icons have `aria-hidden="true"`
  - Active nav links use `aria-current="page"`
  - Toast viewport has `aria-live="polite"`
  - All expandable elements have `aria-expanded`
  - All dropdowns close on Escape key press
  - Search palette has focus trap
  - Badge color contrast verified against WCAG AA (4.5:1 minimum)

## Files Touched
- `web/src/app/admin/users/page.tsx` (admin user management page)
- `web/src/lib/api.ts` (getAdminUsers, updateAdminUserRole)
- `web/src/components/keyboard-shortcuts.tsx` (keyboard shortcuts overlay)
- `web/src/components/navigation.tsx` (aria-current, aria-expanded, keyboard shortcuts mount)
- `web/src/components/search-palette.tsx` (focus trap)
- Various components (aria-label, aria-hidden audit)
