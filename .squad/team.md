# Water-Watcher Team

## Project Context

**Project:** Water-Watcher — Whitewater Rafting Tracker
**User:** Spencer Fowers
**Description:** A web app that lets users enter rivers they're interested in, then routinely scrapes Facebook posts, BLM, National Forest Service, American Whitewater, and other sources for rafting quality, new hazards, best times to run, best campsites, and how to run the rapids. Presents everything in a responsive web app accessible on desktop and mobile. Includes a "Raft Watch" section that monitors Craigslist for rafting gear deals based on user-defined criteria and filters, with notifications for good deals.
**Stack:** TBD (to be decided with the team)
**Casting Universe:** Point Break
